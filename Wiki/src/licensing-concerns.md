# Licensing Concerns

Keep in mind some apps have strict licensing requirements that may not allow or tightly restrict redistribution over the network, and/or commercial usage. Always check the licensing terms of the software you are packaging.

**This repository does not include any packaged installers (`.intunewin` files) or installers directly**, as this would violate the licensing terms of many applications. Instead, we provide scripts and resources to help you create and maintain your own packages which circumvents this issue. However, you are responsible for ensuring that you comply with the licensing terms of the software you are packaging and distributing.
